# The Boring Project

The project that will help students to bring their talents to light and to utilize them.
---
## What for?
---
Remember doing the awesome things during your school/college days which you are very good?
---
But you had to leave that for studying so that you could get a job.
---
- Many students come up with great ideas/prototypes/solutions which can't even be thought of. Then they disappear.
- Indirectly that decelerate motivation. Students just study for sake. Hardly make it through the recruitment.|
- Even Industries struggle to find a good candidate among them.|
- Students are unaware of the current tech trends going on in the industries.|
---
## How?
---
We will be creating a platform which bridges the Students and the Industries.
